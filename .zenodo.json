    "description": "A complete implementation of the Γ-Net (Gamma-Net) architecture: a physics-driven electronic lifeform that models cognition, emotion, pain, sleep, language emergence, and psychopathology through impedance-mismatch equations derived from coaxial transmission line theory. Includes 146 source files (84,500+ lines), 1,876 passing tests, 46 experiments, and a 5-paper research monograph series.",
